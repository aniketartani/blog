                        <p><br>WHAT IS RTE?<br>IT IS RIGHT TO EDUCATION<br><br></p>
                        <p><br><strong>"The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine."- Article 21A, Indian Constitution.&nbsp;</strong>India took a huge step towards sustainable development when it declared to make education a fundamental right of every child on 1st April 2010. The Right to Education Act requires surveys that monitor neighborhoods, identify children requiring education, and setting up facilities for them.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p><br>We, at UPSTART LEAGUE, reckon that education is not mere learning but also sharing knowledge. Education, which is supposed to be a basic right of every individual has become something luxurious in current times. The pandemic has&nbsp;also added fuel to the fire.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;UNESCO, the education of 120 crore children across the world has been disrupted due to school closures, which includes 32.1 crore in India alone. We know that this is a universal crisis, but the impact will be lifelong for poor children. Therefore, with the help of volunteers, we intend to provide elementary education to these underprivileged children to help them pace towards their dreams. Our volunteers spread throughout the country, providing preliminary education to disadvantaged children around their localities. The volunteers help the children in all possible ways by providing textbooks, accessories, and also manual teaching. We strive to provide knowledge to help children having potential pursue their dreams.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
