                        <p><br><strong>HTML 1.0</strong><br>The original version of HTML was HTML 1.0. It had very limited features which greatly limited what you could do in designing your web pages.<br><br><strong>HTML 2.0</strong><br>HTML 2.0 then arrived and included all the features of HTML 1.0 plus several new features for web page design. Until January, 1997, HTML 2.0 was the standard in web page design.<br><br><br><strong>HTML 3.0</strong><br>HTML 2.0 served its purpose very well, but many people designing web pages (called HTML authors or webmasters) wanted more control over their web pages and more ways to mark up their text and enhance the appearance of their websites. Netscape, the leading browser at that time, introduced new tags and attributes called the&nbsp;<strong>Netscape Extension Tags</strong>. Other browsers tried to duplicate them but Netscape did not fully specify their new tags and so these extension tags did not work in most other browsers. It led to considerable confusion and problems when HTML authors used these tags and attributes and then saw that they didn't work as expected in other browsers.<br><br><br><strong>HTML 4.0 (COUGAR)</strong><br>In the early days,&nbsp;<strong><em>HTML 4.0</em></strong>&nbsp;was code-named&nbsp;<strong><em>COUGAR</em></strong>. This version introduces new functionality, most of which comes from the expired HTML 3.0 draft. This version became a recommendation in December, 1997 and a standard as of April, 1998. Explorer has done a very good job in implementing the many features of HTML 4.0. Unfortunately, Netscape has not kept pace. The latest version of Netscape Communicator still does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;recognize the many tags and attributes introduced with HTML 4.0. This means that a web page that involves HTML 4.0 specific tags will look great in Explorer but can look disastrous in Netscape.<br><br><br><strong>XHTML</strong><br>You would think that the next major version after HTML 4.0 would be HTML 5.0 and with it would come a bunch of new tags that would do all sorts of wonderful things. That would be a good guess - but it would also be a wrong guess. The next version of HTML after HTML 4 is&nbsp;<strong>XHTML</strong>.<strong>XHTML</strong>&nbsp;stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible&nbsp;<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>arkup&nbsp;<strong>L</strong>anguage.<br><br><br><strong>HTML 5</strong><br><strong>HTML 5</strong>&nbsp;(usually written&nbsp;<strong>HTML5</strong>) is the new web standard. It follows HTML 4 (which came out way back in 1997) and XHTML. Since the introduction of HTML4, a lot has happened with the web, and something needed to be done to address all the new technologies and the latest multimedia. HTML5 is the result of cooperation that began in 2006 between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). While HTML5 is still evolving (still under development), the latest browsers do support many of the new features and elements in this version. The basic aim of HTML5 is to provide two things - (1) to improve the language and (2) to support the latest multimedia.<br><br></p>
